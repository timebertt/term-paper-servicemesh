# Abstracting Inter-Service Communication of Microservices using a Service Mesh

## Abstract

By now, the microservices architectural style has been well-established in the entire software industry and has proven to provide great flexibility in development, continuous deployment, faster innovation and incredibly high scalability. Though, running large-scale microservice-oriented applications will face development and operations teams with difficult challenges of distributed computing, especially in service-to-service communication.
By leveraging a service mesh, inter-service communication is abstracted and transparently managed across the whole fleet of microservices. With this, cross-cutting concerns like smart traffic management, secure communication and deep observability are extracted out of the application code, allowing developers to focus on business logic again. This paper connects the dots between microservices, containerization, Kubernetes and Service meshes, presenting the concrete problems each of them solve.
