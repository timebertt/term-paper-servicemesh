By now the software industry has firmly agreed on the benefits of implementing modern software applications in a microservices-oriented manner. Compared to monolithic applications, a microservice-oriented architecture brings a lot of advantages including flexibility in development and deployment, faster innovation, individual resource management and scaling of single services.
Though, implementing applications in such a distributed fashion also brings a number of challenges in inter-service communication, especially for applications with a high number of services written in different programming languages. These challenges include: consistent traffic management, security and observability.
A Service Mesh can help solving these challenges by abstracting inter-service communication and moving it out of individual services. Every service is equipped with a "sidecar" proxy governing service-to-service communication. This way common rules and mechanisms for communication can be applied without touching the services' codebase.
