# Summary

In this paper, the microservices-oriented architectural style has been presented with the motivation behind it and its most common characteristics. It was discussed, why containerization and using Kubernetes as a deployment underlay for microservices are a great fit and which benefits they provide to teams developing and operating applications in a microservice-oriented manner. After that, the challenges that microservice-oriented applications are still left with when leveraging containerization and Kubernetes were outlined.

Connecting to these challenges, the service mesh concept with its architectural design was introduced and shown how it is abstracting inter-service communication of microservices. Next, popular implementations of the service mesh concept were presented along with the advantages and disadvantages of using a service mesh in a microservices-oriented application.
With that, it was outlined which concrete problems the service mesh pattern and popular implementations are able to solve and were future work is still needed.
Lastly, it was presented how Lyft – an early adopter and promoter of the service mesh pattern – is addressing concrete challenges with a service mesh in their application. In that it was shown, that implementing a service mesh can provide powerful mechanisms to avoid cascading failure in a real-world large-scale distributed application.

Using a service mesh for microservices-oriented applications allows application developers to focus on business logic of their microservices again by abstracting inter-service communication and addressing cross-cutting concerns of service-to-service communication. It provides consistent traffic management across the whole application, as well as security and observability.
Although there are many advantages of leveraging service mesh technology, it's not a silver bullet for solving all problems of microservices. Small-scale applications might not need a service mesh and might actually be better of not dealing with additional complexity of a service mesh. The place were a service mesh is able to shine and provide real benefits is in large-scale applications with massive inter-service communication and a high number of microservices.
